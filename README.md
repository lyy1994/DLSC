# Deep Learning Short Course
I used to teach a Deep Learning Short Course at 2016 Fall. Here are materials I utilized.

I also manage to write a Deep Learning online book with moderate size. See my post *Deep Learning Short Course* in [my blog](http://lyy1994.github.io/) or *Preface* of this [draft](https://lyy1994.gitbooks.io) for reasons.

If this book is finished, I will transfer it to this repository so that everyone can **pull request**.
